A good example is the position of the radius vs the ulna. This skeleton is positioned in the anatomical reference pose for humans, meaning the skull is facing forward, the legs are firmly planted in the ground, and the hands are gently to the side with palms facing forward. Reference poses are important because relative positional terms can change during the course of a movement. Let's see if you can figure out which bone is the radius vs the ulna. In tetrapods, we would say the radius is anterior to the ulna, but the term you will find in human anatomy literature is lateral (meaning further away from the midline of the body). The opposite term is medial (meaning closer to the midline of the body), which could be used as follows: \"the ulna is medial to the radius\". Anterior vs posterior and medial vs lateral are both valid ways of describing the same structure - it just depends on the context in which you are using these terms.

Conodonts, broadly speaking, resemble [lampreys](recedhgwGlGZAqAjW) in body form, long and eel-like, though they are distinct as well in many regards. The conodont elements pictured here are so abundant throughout the fossil record that they are often used to date important geologic transitions. The elements themselves are false teeth - they may have functioned similar to teeth in terms of catching and feeding on prey, but they were not composed of enamel or dentine. Vertebrates are set apart from other chordates by the presence of a vertebral column, or backbone. Much of the fossil record of vertebrates is known from these two hard tissues - bones and teeth - which each appeared early on for the group. To understand the origin of hard tissues in vertebrates, let's look closer at the massive placoderm, [*Dunkleosteus*](rec7hGM2G0ZlupSeE)."

All receive signals from cranial nerves that emerge from the brain. The eyes of humans are camera eyes, meaning they use a lens to receive and focus the light received from the external environment. However, there are many different types of eyes found in nature, oftentimes evolving convergently through entirely separate lineages (like the camera eye of [cephalopods](recTjfow54KMeHsmW)). Perhaps the simplest light-sensing organs are what you might find on a [flatworm](reccULoyIHfhLllbK) - tiny eyespots consisting of a single layer of photosensitive cells, capable only of detecting the intensity of light."

One of the key differences between the camera eyes of cephalopods and the camera eyes of humans has to do with the retina. In humans, we have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the eye towards the brain due to absence of the retinal layer (where light is received) at that position. However, in cephalopods the retinal layer evolved on top of the nerve fibers, so it is not lacking at the position of the optic nerve. Oh, by the way, this model you are looking at now is actually made of glass. It is part of a number of glass models created by father-and-son team Rudolf and Leopold Blaschka in the late 1800s (some of which can be found at the Harvard Museum of Natural History), hence the name 'Blaschka' squid."
