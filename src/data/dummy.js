The name \"*Tiktaalik*\", proposed by the Nunavut Council of Elders, means \"large freshwater fish\" in the local Inuktitut language. *Tiktaalik* helps us understand the connection between aquatic fish and land-dwelling tetrapods in the fossil record, which is especially apparent in its [pectoral fin](recXLi2Ahykn7TwGP) anatomy. We will revisit this fossil several times throughout the course to learn more about our Inner Fish."
